Readme:
====================================

Pounce is a simple downloader written in Python.  It can be run from the command line where it presents
a menu to the user, guiding them through a simple process in order to get online resources, or it can be
provided with command line arguments, foregoing the walkthrough.

Example usage (CLI with args):
------------------------------

Simple single file downloading:

./pounce.py -u http://www.pathtoresource.com/resource.file -o /path/to/save/in/

Download links contained in a text file:
