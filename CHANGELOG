Changelog:

Pounce-v1.0:
    Renamed program.
    Version worthy of 1.0
    Removed unneeded command line arguments.
    Added/clarified docstrings.
    Works with .csv files for those that care.
    Bug fixes:
        Fixed an issue where only the last file downloaded via file input would display in DBUS notifications.
        All files are now correctly displayed in notifications upon completion of their download.

Piddle-v0.3.dev:
    New Version
    Now requires:
        Python>=3.2
        notify2
        progressbar
    Refactored Notification class down to notification function.
    Replaced threading module with multiprocessing.
        Multiprocessing only works for command line arguments, not for interface downloads.

Piddle-v0.2.dev:
	New version
	Added requisite modules to setup.py:
		We are now requiring Python-2.7.2+
		We won't install without pynotify and progressbar
	Added notification class to let users know when file downloads are complete.
		This feature is mostly for users who will use the "links in text file" feature
		as it will allow them to hide their terminal and receive a file by file notification
		of download completion.
	Corrected errors in method calls that were not being called with parent class instances.

Piddle-v0.1.dev:
	Initial release.
	Initial features:
		Takes a text file as an argument, will loop over each line in the text file
		and attempt to download each link.
		
		Command line arguments.
			Optional text file as arg or single link

		Terminal menu (text)
